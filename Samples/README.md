Disclaimer: Samples here are collected from various external sources. No claims are made to their content and no assurances are made about their behaviour.

Compatibility note: Some of these examples cannot run effectively on a system whose performance is significantly different from the intended target system, that being a typical desktop system from in or around the early 1990s. In some cases, modifications have been made specifically to the timing code to allow samples to run properly. These modified versions are named with an "X" at the end of the filename.

E.g.:

- `NIBBLES.BAS` => `NIBBLESX.BAS`
- `GORILLA.BAS` => `GORILLAX.BAS`
